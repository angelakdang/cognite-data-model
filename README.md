Install virtual environment with `poetry install`

Create a `.env` file that contains the following information:

```bash
AZURE_TENANT_ID=
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=

CDF_CLUSTER=
CDF_CLIENT_NAME=
CDF_PROJECT_NAME=
```

Run the `bootstrap.py` file to populate the CDF project with data. The data is just dummy data and has no value significance.
